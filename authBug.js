The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger consistently, especially in edge cases or with complex application states.  This can result in unexpected behavior, such as data not loading correctly or authentication failing silently. For example, consider a situation where the app is launched and the user is already signed in. The listener might be delayed in firing or fail to trigger at all, leaving the app in a state where it believes the user is not authenticated.
