# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener. In certain scenarios, the listener may not fire consistently, leading to authentication and data synchronization problems.  The `authBug.js` file shows the problematic behavior, while `authSolution.js` provides a possible workaround.

**Problem:** The listener may not trigger immediately when the app starts with an existing user session. This could lead to components attempting to access data before authentication is complete, resulting in errors.

**Solution:** The suggested solution involves using a combination of `onAuthStateChanged` and additional checks, perhaps leveraging a loading state management system to show a loading indicator while ensuring data is not accessed prematurely.
